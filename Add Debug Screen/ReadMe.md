This minimum amount of code required to add a working Debug Screen to your mod.

Copy the file "DebugMod.cs" to your mod project, and copy the code in ITMPlugin.HandleInput() and ITMPlugin.Draw(), as well as the variables defined at the top of the class to your mod to add a working Debug Screen. From there, you can start adding variables to debug, or even add more debug screens if one isn't enough.
